## ðŸ§© Project Overview

This project explores several topics in **low-level data representation** and **performance optimization** using RISC-V assembly and C.

It includes:
- Implementation of **bfloat16 (BF16)** arithmetic  
- Encoding and decoding of **Unsigned Floating-8 (UF8)** format  
- Optimization of **LeetCode 2571** using a **branchless CLZ** (Count Leading Zeros) approach

The branchless CLZ method successfully reduced control hazards in the pipeline, improving overall efficiency, even though the instruction count increased.
